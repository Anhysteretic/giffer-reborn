Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 BLINKS ON and OFF for 1 second, TWO TIMES and then remains OFF for seconds then repeats the sequence over and over…..\n3.  Modify the program by changing the variable name from t to waitTime. Compile and upload to verify that the program still works as before.…\n4.  Modify the program by changing delay(4000); to delay(waitTime\\*4); Compile and upload to verify that the program still works as before...\n5.  Modify the program so that LED 9 blinks four times, quickly using a 200 millisecond delay between on / off\n6.
