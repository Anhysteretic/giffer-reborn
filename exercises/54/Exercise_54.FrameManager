That’s called a potentiometer. You turn it, and the Arduino can read what position it is in. We’d like to change our program’s behavior based on what the potentiometer is doing. For this, we need to make some decisions. Perfect job for if/else statements. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">First, we need to know what pins the knob / potentiometer can change. The potentiometer is connectected to two pins on the arduino - similarly to how the LED’s are connected to pins on the Arduino. However - with the pins connected to the potentiometer the pins are inputs on the Arduino as opposed to the LED’s which are outputs on the Arduino.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Input / Output pins - what’s the difference?</span></b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Output pins</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">, we have been using them to turn on and off the LEDs in our light sculpture board - </span><b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Send information to the light sculpture board.</span></b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Input pins</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">,  we will be using them to get information from the light sculpture board. </span><b><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Getting information from the user using the light sculpture board.</span></b></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For this first exercise using the potentiometer, we will only be focusing on the first pin connected to the potentiometer. Pin 18 on the Arduino is connected to the potentiometer like an ON / OFF switch. If you rotate the Knob from all the way clockwise to all the way counterclockwise you will hear a click at the end of its counterclockwise rotation. This click is connecting Pin 18 on the Arduino to ground. If we rotate the Knob clockwise you will the click again and that means that Pin 18 is no longer connected to ground. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When Pin 18 is connected to ground - if we read its value from the Arduino Pin 18 = 0. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">When Pin 18 is not connected to ground - if we read its value from the Arduino Pin 18 = 1.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Second, we need to know how to read in a value from the potentiometer.
