These operators are useful for modifying a variable's value.\n\n \n\n1. Each delay should be of duration pin * 100.  Notice that you can have expressions as inputs to functions.\n\n2. Notice the example while loop given.  This runs while the condition inside the () is true.  You will need to copy and modify this example for void loop.\n\n3. The Serial Monitor Output will guide and comment your code.  \n\n4. You will have to figure out what n should be for each step to get the desired output.\n\n5. You need to have the correct Serial Monitor Output in the correct frames for Giffer to recognize your code as correct.\n\n6. You may copy-paste the strings from below, printing the variable where indicated.  To output the correct text to the Serial Monitor, use code such as the following.  \n\n7. You may use this to as a starting point:\n \nNEW:  void setup()\nDESCRIPTION:  setup happens ONLY once under the following conditions:\nA) When the Arduino is Turned on\nB) When the Arduino is Reset – find the reset button\nC) When downloading a program to the Arduino and resetting the Arduino\nD) Notice that D13 flashes 3 times to indicate successful reset\n\nNEW:  pinMode(2, OUTPUT); \nDESCRIPTION: Enables pin 2 on the Arduino to Send enough power to turn on LED attached to pin 2\nUsage - now the arduino MAY (enabled / allowed) turn on the LED attached to pin2. This instruction however does not tell the arduino to turn on the LED attached to pin 2. That instruction is digitalWrite(2,HIGH) and we will talk about that shortly.\n\nNEW:  void loop()\nDESCRIPTION: loop() happens OVER and OVER again forever AFTER setup() finishes:\n\nNEW:  delay(5000);\nDESCRIPTION:  Tells Arduino to wait 5000ms or 5 seconds before going to the next line\n\nACTIVITIES:\n1.\tCopy the program from Starting Point Exercise01 into the Arduino IDE.
