This instruction however does not tell the arduino to turn on the LED attached to pin 2. That instruction is digitalWrite(2,HIGH) and we will talk about that shortly.\n\nNEW:  void loop()\nDESCRIPTION: loop() happens OVER and OVER again forever AFTER setup() finishes:\n\nNEW:  delay(5000);\nDESCRIPTION:  Tells Arduino to wait 5000ms or 5 seconds before going to the next line\n\nACTIVITIES:\n1.\tCopy the program from Starting Point Exercise01 into the Arduino IDE. Compile and upload this program to the Arduino\n2.\tVerify that no LEDs light up\n3.\tSave the completed sketch as YourFirstLastName_Exercise01 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n4.\tCreate a file  that contains your animated gif and source code. Call it  YourFirstLastName_Exercise01\n5.\tUpload the file that contains your animated gif and source code to Upload Completed Exercise01 as evidence that you have completed Exercise01\n6.\tIf you have questions about the file creation and upload process - see the page How to Complete Exercises 01 - 30"}
