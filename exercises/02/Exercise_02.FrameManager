{"number":"2","directions":"Exercise02: Turn on an LED.\n \nNEW:  digitalWrite(2,HIGH); \nDESCRIPTION: Tells Arduino to send enough power to make LED attached to pin 2 light up.\n \n ACTIVITIES:\n\n• Copy the program from Starting Point Exercise02 into the Arduino IDE. \n• Compile and upload this program to the Arduino and verify that LED 2 lights up.\n• Exercise: Remove the; from the end of the line: digitalWrite(2, HIGH);\n• Try to compile and upload the program. You should get a compiler error.\n• Look at the compiler error (red cryptic message at bottom of screen) – this it what happens when we are missing a semi-colon\n• Fix the program so it compiles (put the ; back in at the end of digitalWrite(2, HIGH);\n• Verify that there is no compiler error and that LED 2 lights up.\n• Modify the program so the Arduino Turns on LEDs 2 and 3.\n• Modify the program so the Arduino Turns on LEDs 2, 3 and 4.\n• Save the completed sketch as YourInitials_Exercise02 in: Documents – Arduino – Exercises\n• Copy the code into the Giffer website\n• Enter your name and exercise number.\n• Select the Run and Grade button.\n• Look at the resulting Output image and make sure it is correct (Correct at lower part of image)\n• If it is Correct -  use the Copy Page button to copy the evidence that you have correctly completed the exercise to clipboard.\n• Go to CL 10.3.02 Upload Completed Exercise02:  And upload evidence that you have completed Exercise01\n• Click \"Prepare an answer\" on NEO\n• Click the \"<>\" (Source code) button.\n• Paste by pressing CTRL + V\n• Submit\n• If you made changes to the code in Giffer, then Copy the code from Giffer and paste it into the Arduino and re-save it as: YourInitials_Exercise02 - in your Documents/Arduino/Exercises Folder.","startingCode":"void setup()\n\n{\n    pinMode(2, OUTPUT); // Enables pin 2 on the Arduino to Send enough power (current)\n                                       // to turn on LED attached to pin 2}\n}\n\nvoid loop()\n{\n    digitalWrite(2, HIGH); // Tells Arduino to send enough power to make LED\n                        // attached to pin 2 turn on\n    delay(5000);  // wait 5000ms or 5 seconds before going to the next line\n}","suffix":"int main() {\n  setup();\n  loop();\n  return 0;\n}\n","board":{"type":"LED Board","setup":{"pinKeyframes":[]}},"frameManager":{"frames":[{"ledModes":{"2":1,"3":1,"4":1},"ledStates":{"2":1023,"3":1023,"4":1023},"postDelay":5000,"outputText":[]},{"ledModes":{"2":1,"3":1,"4":1},"ledStates":{"2":1023,"3":1023,"4":1023},"postDelay":0,"outputText":[]}],"currentFrame":1,"elapsedTime":5000,"isGraded":true,"grade":true}}
