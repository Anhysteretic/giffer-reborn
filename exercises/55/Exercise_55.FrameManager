The potentiometer also has a variable resistor that the Arduino interprets as a value from 0 to 1023. This variable resistor is connected to pin A5 on the Arduino. Note this is pin A5 versus pin 5. The A in A5 denotes that it is an analog pin which means that instead of values 0 (LOW) or 1 (HIGH) it has 1024 values between 0(LOW) and 1023 (HIGH). </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Because we can in theory distinguish 1024 different values we can tell the Arduino to do many different things based on what value we read from A5.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">So now we know there are two pins connected to the potentiometer. 18 and A5. 18 is a digital pin - with valid read values 0 (LOW) and 1 (HIGH). A5 is analog with valid read values 0 (LOW) all the way up to 1023 (HIGH).  </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Pin 18 on the Arduino is connected to the potentiometer like an ON / OFF switch. If you rotate the Knob from all the way clockwise to all the way counterclockwise you will hear a click at the end of its counterclockwise rotation. This click is connecting Pin 18 on the Arduino to ground. If we rotate the Knob clockwise you will the click again and that means that Pin 18 is no longer connected to ground. At the point of clockwise rotation just after you hear the click which indicates pin 18 is connected to 5V (or is HIGH) pin A5 should read 0 (LOW). As you continue to rotate clockwise A5 will increase up to a read value of 1023 (HIGH).</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To read the analog value on A5, we need to do the following: </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.5999999999999999; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">int value = analogRead(5);</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 36pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">analogRead() is a function that can read analog values from pins on the Arduino.
